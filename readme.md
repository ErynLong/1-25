I had difficulty establishing relationships between the tables. When I would draw a line to do so, it would place unwanted columns in the table i'm creating a relationship to. The relationships are listed below:
    - Customer to Ticket is a one to many relationship.
    - Customer to Concession is a one to many relationship.
    - Customer to Payment is a one to many relationship.
    - Customer to Movie is a many to many relationship; Ticket is the join table.
